Founded in 2010, the [Grid Protection Alliance's](https://www.gridprotectionalliance.org/about.html) first open source products were designed to support [real-time synchrophasor data systems](https://www.gridprotectionalliance.org/phasor-overview.html). In 2013 GPA expanded its open source products to solve other utility information management problems including products to manage and present data from [Digital Fault Recorders (DFRs) and Power Quality Meters](https://www.gridprotectionalliance.org/pq-overview.html), and an [information historian](https://www.gridprotectionalliance.org/phasor-Historian.html#scroll-target-openHistorian1) that can be used to solve a broader range of utility information issues.

This GitHub organizational site hosts all of GPA's main open source products.
