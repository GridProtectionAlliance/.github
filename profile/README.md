The [Grid Protection Alliance (GPA)](https://www.gridprotectionalliance.org) is a not-for-profit corporation specializing in the development and support of open source software solutions for the electric industry.

Founded in 2010, GPA's first open source products were designed to support real-time synchrophasor data systems. In 2013 GPA expanded its open source products to solve other utility information management problems including products to manage and present data from Digital Fault Recorders (DFRs) and Power Quality Meters, and an information historian that can be used to solve a broader range of utility information issues.

This GitHub site hosts all of GPA's main open source products.
